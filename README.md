A high-performance parallel implementation of the **Marching Squares** algorithm using OpenMP, designed for contour extraction from 2D scalar fields. This project explores parallelization strategies in the context of the **PRAM (Parallel Random Access Machine)** model and provides comprehensive performance analysis including FLOPS measurements and architecture comparisons.
